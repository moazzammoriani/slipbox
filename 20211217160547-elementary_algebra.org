#+title: Elementary Algebra

Elementary builds on arithmetic and its operations, allowing us to reason about numbers without necessarily knowing what the numbers actually are. This is useful becuase: 
- it allows us to write down expressions and identities for properties that our numbers have. 
- It also also allows us to find unknown numbers by making inferences about it to solve equations
- It allows us to express an algorithms more precisely.
