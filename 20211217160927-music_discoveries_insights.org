- Moving down Minor seventh #4 chords and min-maj7 chords down Minor thirds is a beautiful sound.
- it's better exercise of accuracy to be singing the note in tune immediately in one breath.
- i should keep a journal of my subjective thoughts associated with specific timbres. melodies, interval, chords, rhythms.
- I've noticed that I can isolate the sound of different notes being played simultaneously.
    - I should visualize that piano roll type system I created to think about the notes.
- I can very easily pickup where I left with my guitar playing.
