#+title: Propositional Logic

 Propositional logic is concerned with the [[145616022021|validity]] of [[150316022021|arguments]] which consist of [[153316022021|propositions]] combined with [[Logical Connectives]]--a syntactically valid combination of statements and connectives is called a [[Well-formed Formulas|well-formed formula]]. In propositional logic, whole propositions or well-formed formulas can be represented using symbols e.g '$A, B, C,\dots, P, Q ,R\dots$'. All propositions can have a [[Truth Value|truth value]] of either true or false. Each logical connective is defined in terms of its [[Truth Table|truth table]]. A truth table can also be used to prove the validity of any argument. If any two statements have the same truth table then we say that those statements are [[171217022021|equivalent]]. Certain statements involving connectives are always true, they are called [[Tautologies|tautologies]], and indeed some of them are also always false, and they are called [[Contradictions|contradictions]].  As a consequence of the definitions of the logical connectives, there arise some general [[Equivalence laws|patterns of equivalence]] with the use of logical connectives which can be justified through intuition as well.
