Created: Dec 1, 2020 11:18 AM

Casework is the act of reducing a procedure to a finite number of steps. Casework is useful in a number of situations; mathematical, computational or otherwise.  Below is a checklist to make sure that there have been no errors in the carrying out of casework.

- [ ]  Understood the condition.
- [ ]  Determined the conditions a case must pass in order to be accounted for.
- [ ]  Identified the boundary cases.
- [ ]  Identified any sub-cases and their corresponding sub-conditions.
- [ ]  Started on a boundary case.
- [ ]  Ended on a boundary case.
