#+title: The Physical Layer

This layer is concerned with how bits are transferred through some trasmission medium. The bits are transmitted through serial communication are encoded in electrical, radio and optical signals.

At this layer a the main concern of networking would be the choosing the appropriate technology for a particular networking task. For example, if  I would like to set a up a data center I would need to decide whether devices should be connected wirelessly or through wires and what type of cables should would be fast enough to and which ones would be overkill.

So yeah
