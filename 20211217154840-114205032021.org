*As tempting as it may be, you cannot simply dictate your future self to spend time according to some rigid schedule.* It is a good idea perhaps to set some guidelines instead.

You can have no idea about what the future holds and you cannot have complete control over anything so any sort of future planning should take this into account. There will be days where you will not do something either because that activity is not habituated enough, you did not find the time because you were preoccuppied with something else or simply because of no reason at all.
