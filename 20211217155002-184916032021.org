The associative law in propositional logic says that if $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are propositions then

$$\begin{align}
P\lor (Q\lor R) \text{ is equivalent to } (P\lor Q) \lor R\\
\text{and } P\land (Q\land R) \text{ is equivalent to } (P\land Q) \lor R.
\end{align}$$

This can be proven by comparing the truth tables in both the statements.
