#+title: While loop

A while loop is a [[Control Flow|control flow]] statement which implements iteration where the number of iterations are controlled by a conditional statement. 

A while loop runs if the given conditioninal statement is true hence it is necessary for the [[Conditional Statements|conditional statement]] to have a truth value that is false otherwise we may get an [[Infinite loop|infinite loop]] that may prevent a program from [[Halting|halting]].
